“Jenny, did you burn your hair or something?”<br>
“No,” I said. “Why?”<br>
“It just looks… brittle.”<br>
That’s what my husband said to me when he ran his fingers through my hair.<br>
<b>My hair was getting thin, and I had split ends everywhere.</b><br>
I knew it didn’t look great, but I didn’t think my husband would notice. <br>(Since when does he notice small details, anyway?)<br>
So anyway, I started to do what any woman would do.
I found a new shampoo and conditioner for my frustrating hair.
At first, I thought it was helping…
But after a week or two, I noticed that even more hair was falling out.
My hair was still getting thin and weak, so I decided to take things more serious.
I bought a more expensive shampoo and conditioner that some gorgeous YouTube star recommended. <br>(Never mind that she probably had perfect hair anyway.)
<p class="blogp">
<b>Even the super-expensive shampoo and conditioner, with all the vitamins and nutrients added to it, still couldn’t fix my thinning hair.</b></p>
<p class="blogp">
I was spending over $40 a month on shampoo and conditioner, plus all the extra stuff I was putting on after my shower, like finishing sprays.
I even woke up an hour early so I could stop blow-drying my hair…
None of it worked.
Considering how expensive these products were, I thought, “maybe my hair is just stuck like this forever.”
If spending $40 a month at Ulta wasn’t going to fix my hair, nothing could.
I even thought about cutting my hair really short to cover up the fact that my hair was thin, breaking, and ugly.
But I knew my husband just wouldn’t be into it.
So I took things one step further.</p>
<p class="blogp">
<b>I asked my friend, a pharmacist, if she could give me a prescription.</b></p>
<p class="blogp">I was desperate.
Every time I looked in the mirror, it didn’t matter if I had flawless skin or my best-fitting dress… all I saw was a head of hair that looked absolutely awful.
So I asked a pharmacist, one of my good friends from high school, if there was a prescription drug that could fix my problem.
I explained to her that I was using those shampoos and conditioners (and sprays, and mousses…).
Then she stopped me.
</p>
<p class="blogp">
<b>“The Vitamins and Nutrients in Shampoos and Conditioners Can’t Really Fix Your Hair.”</b></p>
<p class="blogp" align="left">
What?!<br>
I was floored.<br>
Here’s what she told me:<br>
“Your hair is already dead when it grows out. If it’s not treated <b>from the inside</b>, you can’t fix it up later.”</p>
<br>
<p class="blogp">
<b>Shampoos and Conditioners Only “Cover Up” Your Hair.</b>
<br><b>If You Want to Fix Your Thin Hair and Split Ends, 
You Have to Start from the Inside.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="blogp" align="left">
You can imagine how angry I was after spending $40 a month on a bunch of shampoo and conditioner that couldn’t even fix my hair.
You see, as she explained to me, shampoos and conditioners can “cover up” your hair, wrapping around the follicles and making it look like your hair is improving.
But in reality, it’s just hiding the truth.
And while you’re covering up your hair, <b>it’s slowly getting worse and worse</b> below the surface.
Instead of making your hair better, you’re actually watching it get thin and brittle.
I was furious.
$40 a month for a premium shampoo and conditioner that was scientifically useless?!<br>
<b>But things started to look up…</b><br>
</p>
<p class="blogp"><b>She Told Me I Didn’t Need a Prescription Drug. <br>I Could Get Beautiful, Silky Smooth Hair Using a 
Simple, All-Natural Supplement.</b></p>

It was almost too good to be true.

But the science backed it up:

Hair Eternity was a simple, all-natural supplement that rejuvenated my hair from the inside, creating the perfect hair I worked so hard for.

And it was incredibly easy!

I don’t have to tell you how annoying it is to try styling your hair when it’s dry, thin, and split.

Instead of doing all that work, I just took this natural supplement and watched my hair grow back healthy, fuller, and smooth.

In fact, my hair even looks great when I roll out of bed. (And you can ask anyone in my family: good natural hair does not run in my genes!)

<p>

<b>Day 3</b><br>

After the first three days, I could tell that my hair was improving. It had even grown 1 cm (I actually measured). Right away, I was excited about how effective it was.
<br>
<b>Day 7</b><br>

The first week was amazing.

My hair had much more volume. A few people thought I was wearing a wig or had surgery because of how big the difference was.

Plus, my hair grew 1 inch in the first week. My hair was really coming back, and I knew I didn’t have to live with thinning, frustrating hair anymore.
<br>
<b>Day 11</b><br>

Okay, checking in for Day 11!

My hair has completely stopped falling out in disgusting handfuls in the shower. I have full, beautiful hair.

I just came back from the salon, and my hairdresser was amazed at how full my hair was. She was a little shy about asking what I was doing, but finally she came out and said it. “What on Earth are you doing for your hair? It’s amazing!”

I told her my secret, and she actually stopped cutting my hair to write it down.
<br>
<b>Day 17</b><br>

It’s been over two weeks now.

My husband is so excited about my hair. He said, “I didn’t want to say anything before, but your hair is really looking great now.” I wish he had just told me how bad it was!

I’m so much more confident now, and my hair is full, smooth, and strong. No more split ends! This has been the biggest transformation of my life, hands down.

<b>P.S.</b>

Thanks for reading.

I know you have a lot of things going on in your life, and worrying about your hair shouldn’t be one of them.

The media makes us think that if we don’t have perfect hair (or perfect curves, or flawless skin), our boyfriends and husbands will leave us.

That somehow, our entire life depends on looking perfect.

I know that’s not true.

But that doesn’t mean that looking my best isn’t important to me.

Honestly, in this world, how we look changes how people treat us. I’ve even been getting more respect at work now that my hair doesn’t look so brittle and thin.

It’s not fair, but that’s just how it is.

Fortunately, we don’t have to keep throwing money at premium products that don’t work.

I know Hair Eternity will give you the “roll out of bed” amazing hair you deserve, because it’s scientifically proven, and it worked for me.

So please don’t miss your chance to try it out. <br>

It’s just $0.79 per day.<br>

But you don’t want to miss out on incredible hair that’s naturally strong and beautiful.
